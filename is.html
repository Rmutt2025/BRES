           You made it this far. <br />
           Are you okay? Are you tired? <br />
            Do you need to rest? Aren’t you tired yet?  <br />
            So many questions, so many questions…  <br />
            is it even worth it? What is there, at the end?  <br />
            The end, does it matter? What if there’s nothing, you ask me.  <br />
            I ask you, if there is nothing, what about it?  <br />
Are you still curious? Curious is a bad word. <br />
 Bad word… but you made it this far. <br />
